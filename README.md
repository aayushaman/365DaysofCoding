# 365DaysOfCoding

This is a GitHub repository for tracking my progress in a personal coding challenge of coding every day for 365 days.

## Motivation
As a passionate coder, I want to improve my skills and knowledge by dedicating time every day to coding. By creating this repository, I aim to keep myself accountable and motivated throughout the challenge.

## Goals
- Code every day for 365 days.
- Learn and practice new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.
- Complete personal coding projects and contribute to open-source projects.
- Document my progress and share it with the community.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

365DaysOfCoding/
├── day001/
│   └── code.py
├── day002/
│   └── app.js
├── day003/
│   └── index.html
├── ...
├── day365/
│   └── readme.md
└── readme.md
 
 and so on and so forth.
 
 
- Each day's code is stored in a separate directory, named `day001`, `day002`, etc., representing the day of the challenge.
- Inside each day's directory, there may be one or more code files relevant to the day's work.
- The `readme.md` file in each day's directory may contain a description of the day's progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
- The root `readme.md` file contains an overview of the challenge, goals, and motivation.

## Progress
I will update the progress of my coding challenge in the `readme.md` file of each day's directory. I will also document my achievements, learnings, and any other relevant information.

## Contribution
As an open-source repository, contributions from the community are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


Let's embark on this coding journey together! Happy coding!
